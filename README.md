Problem Statement:

An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and provide a good restaurant discovery experience.
The bot should be able to identify common synonyms for cities and entities like cuisine and should be able to handle the errors gracefully. The bot should display results according the user preferred City, Cuisine, Budget and Average cost for two people in descending order of the User Ratings for restaurants. It should be able to check the valid email id and send the details to email if requested by user.
